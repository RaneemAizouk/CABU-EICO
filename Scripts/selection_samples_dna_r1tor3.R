# DATA EXPLORATION
#####################################################
# This code is selecting households per cluster to follow up over time for sequencing.
# The code is selecting from households  which were included in round 0 (see selection_samples_dna.R)

# Considering we tested up to 6 individuals in the household, and with the identifiability of the model in mind, 
# we might, for r1 â€“ r4 reconsider which households we include for sequencing, i.e. exclude household larger 
# than 10 household members and take and additional number of households compared to the ones we selected 
# in the first round (in total we can select 850 household members over 4 rounds).
